"""
CloudBolt Software programming exercise. Implement the paginate function,
which takes as inputs:
    file_text (str): the full text of a CSV file, including headers
    sort_by (str): the name of the column to sort by
    page_size (int): the number of records to display per page
    page_num (int): the page number to display
The function should return a new CSV-formatted string where the first line
contains the same headers as the input text and the remaining lines are the
records to display after applying pagination.

The minimum valid value for page_size and page_num is 1. As an example,
page_size=10 and page_num=2 would display records 11-20 after applying sorting.
